# Demo Expense Management App
This is a simple web app written in React and TypeScript. It's used for a demo of [SUSE RKE2 Kubernetes](https://docs.rke2.io/).

there is a branch to deploy it on [OpenShift 4.x](https://github.com/nmajorov/expense-app-web-ui/tree/openshift4).


It uses the [ Deno JavaScript runtime ](https://deno.com/) because I wanted to experiment with it.
